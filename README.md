## 📝 Project Summary

This project presents a **Java-based Algorithm Visualizer** built with **Swing** and **Graphics**.
It provides **interactive animations** for different **sorting** and **searching algorithms**, allowing learners to observe each step in real time.

## 💡 Why Use an Algorithm Visualizer?

Visual representation makes abstract concepts easier to grasp. This project aims to:

🔹 **Highlight Algorithmic Concepts**

* Illustrates how comparisons, swaps, and recursion work
* Explains iterative vs. recursive logic visually
* Demonstrates the internal flow of common algorithms

🔹 **Practical Significance**

* Useful as a teaching and learning tool
* Helps in debugging and analyzing algorithm behavior
* Provides a foundation for algorithm training platforms

🔹 **Educational Benefits**

* Simplifies learning with step-by-step visuals
* Promotes experimentation with user inputs
* Strengthens problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
